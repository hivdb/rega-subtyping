NOTES ON PORTABLE BETA TEST VERSION 4.0b
==============================================

INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------

PAUP* 4.0 beta and associated files are distributed in a tarfile 
archive.  To extract the files from the archive simply move the 
tarfile to the directory where you wish to install the PAUP 
directory and type: 

tar -xf paupxxxx 

Where xxxx is the version name. The PAUP directory contains the 
following files:

paup4b9-xxxxx             //PAUP binary
Docs/Cmd_ref_v2.pdf       //Command reference documentation
Docs/Quick_start_v1.pdf   //introduction to basic PAUP* usage
Release-Notes.txt
Sample_analysis_files/ML_analysis.nex
Sample_analysis_files/MP_analysis.nex
Sample_import_files/GCG.msf
Sample_import_files/hennig86.hen
Sample_import_files/mega.meg
Sample_import_files/nbrf.pir
Sample_import_files/phylip_3x.dat
Sample_import_files/simple.txt
Sample_import_files/tab.txt
Sample_NEXUS_files/angiosperms.nex
Sample_NEXUS_files/avian-ovomucoids.nex
Sample_NEXUS_files/primate-mtDNA-interleaved.nex
Sample_NEXUS_files/primate-mtDNA.nex

In order to execute PAUP, the PAUP binary must be in your search 
path.  Typing "echo $PATH" or "echo $path" will usually tell you 
what directories are in your search path. You can either move the 
PAUP binary to one of the directories already in your path or add 
a new directory to your search path and move the PAUP binary to
the new directory.


DOCUMENTATION and SAMPLE FILES
----------------------------------------------

The file "Cmd_ref_v2.pdf" is an Adobe Acrobat document containing
preliminary documentation.  This document is primarily a "command
reference" and it is still fairly rough.  The document is heavily
hyperlinked and it is easy to navigate using Acrobat 3.0 or later
(http://www.adobe.com/Acrobat).  Newer versions of the manual 
will be made accessible on-line as they become available.  The 
Quick-start tutorial is designed to introduce users with no 
previous experience to the basic usage of PAUP* 4.  After version
4.0 is complete, a paper copy of the final documentation will
be mailed to you.

NEXUS formatted sample data files are provided in the 
Sample_NEXUS_files directory.  The Sample_import_files directory 
contains Non-NEXUS formatted files that PAUP can import with
the "tonexus" command. See the command reference document for more
information regarding the "tonexus" command. Finally, two sample 
analysis files are provided in the Sample_analysis_files directory.
To run one of these files, go to the Sample_analysis_files 
directory and type the name of the PAUP binary followed by the name
of one of the sample files.  For example:

system prompt> paup4b MP_analysis.nex    
  
This example assumes that the paup binary (paup4b) is in your search
path. 


SUPPORT
----------------------------------------------

Support for most issues pertaining to use of PAUP* can be found
on-line at:

http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/support.html   

If you are unable to find an answer to your question on one of our web
pages, we encourage you to post your question to the appropriate 
"conference" at the PAUP*forum web site: 

http://pauptech.csit.fsu.edu/~paupforum/

Since we are not a giant software company with a staff of technical 
support specialists, posting your questions to the PAUP*forum is 
fastest way to get an answer to your question.  Jim Wilgenbusch and I
will try to answer your questions as quickly as possilbe, but our time 
is limited (especially given the need to complete the 4.0 program and 
manual).

There are no restrictions on publication of results using this beta
version (unlike the earlier development versions). The recommended 
citation format is:

Swofford, D. L. 2002. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony 
   (*and Other Methods). Version 4. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, 
   Massachusetts.

Note: Because there are a number of beta and test versions of the 
program you should mention the specific version of PAUP* somewhere 
in the methods. 

REPORTING PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------------

Thank you for taking a chance on this beta version.  Your cooperation in
reporting any bugs or other anomalies would be appreciated. Suggestions 
for enhancements are welcome, although, unless a feature is both extremely 
simple to program and very compelling, new features will have to wait 
until after 4.0 has been completed.

If you report a bug, please be sure to supply all necessary
information that will enable us to replicate it.  This includes:

1. A description of the problem, including a list of all steps that led
   to the bug.  If you can repeat the problem yourself in a well-defined 
   sequence of steps, there is a much greater chance that I will
   be able to fix it.

2. A copy of the data file and any other relevant files (these will kept
   strictly confidential).

3. The exact version number of the program.

4. The CPU and operating system on which you are running the program.

Send reports to:     paup-support@csit.fsu.edu

Please check our "Known Problems" page 

http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/problems.html

before sending your bug report.  There is no need to report bugs that are 
already known.  If there is any question as to whether your bug duplicates
a known problem it would be better to send it in just in case.

Thanks,
Dave Swofford
